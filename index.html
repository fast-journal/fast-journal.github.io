		<p class = "log"> It's after 24 hrs.. I have had a coffee at 3, and did some good exercises then.
		Feeling a bit hungry, all that habitual eating showing itself.
		Need to get some electrolytes and some sugar-free chewing gum.

		<p class = "log"> Had Coffee with Cinnamon. A nice touch actually. Going for a walk, which should speed up the Ketosis further. 
		A few pangs here and there, a drop in strength demonstrated by lackluster singing, a general dullness, but altogether a good feeling.. 
		To the next log..

		<p class = "log"> Came back from the walk. Felt quite moody, many ups and downs within the 90 odd minutes. Feeling like eating a lot. 
		But that's the difference between want and need. Anyway, the usual questions do arise. As to why I have to bring such things in my life. 
		Why did I tamper with the original algorithm, evidently, because I thought I could write a better one, still, even if that were true, why? 
		Could have just lived a great life instead, a version much better than what others' live(thanks to philosophy). Instead, it's just ideas and words, 
		momentary wisps of candy-floss that simply vanish with just the hint of sweetness, leaving us wanting for more. Already a life with so much denied, 
		and I go further and deny myself even food. One thing is for sure, I am not the person who started the fast. I trust him, I admire him, and I will obey him. 
		But he will have to answer to all of my doubts too. He is a hard taskmaster. Okay I should stop talking about him in the third person. DamnüòÇ
		I just did it again.
		But feeling much better after this, idk if coherent, rant..
		Good for me! üòÖ

		<p class = "log"> Got up before half an hour or so. Went to sleep around 12.30, so that's a good one. The day before I could get just 4 hours, 
		Have to say I feel pretty amazing right now, especially after the meltdown of sorts yesterday, I am sore at the right places and in the right amount, 
		relaxed and well rested. I think I had some palpitations this morning, but it's fine now. I need to get some toys to track the chemical response of my body during fasting.
		I just hope the way I feel is generic i.e not affected by my rationalization. But the latter is hard in physiological stuff. Anyway, we will find out in some time. 
		For the time being, I will cherish, for this is the good zone. Looking forward to the 48 hr crossover and my exercises!

		<p class = "log"> A bit late. I meant to log just after I finished my long walking+thinking session(about 12000 steps, 120 mins).
		The fit app is malfunctioning, showing 2 km for 12k steps, which is funny. Anyway.
		I am still surprised with the way I am feeling. There surely is hunger, I feel it pretty strongly. But idk what's with all the energy. 
		I didn't feel any weakness for all the walking I did, and, more interestingly, I am feeling extra focused and sharp. I walked following Tim Ferris' 
		advice to further catalyze the ketosis, and it seems to be working. Still haven't taken the fats(1 tablespoon olive oil, Cod liver oil) I plan to, 
		nor the lemon water. No Electral either, it contains glucose. Only salt till now. 
		I am not doing those things as long as possible so that I have something to look forward to.
		Fingers crossed to reach 96 hours with the same mental state.
		One moment at a timeü§ò

		<p class = "log"> The sub happy smiley is to account for what I was feeling at that place, that God forbidden ground where I go to walk. 
		White lights are the bane of mankind, they should be gathered and put inside the deepest recesses of hell.
		Making me feel down when there wasn't a need to. There was a moment in the ground, and another when I opened the fridge and saw bread and 
		mayonnaise and jam, to just grab it and put it down. But feeling better now.üòÇ
		To the next log! Chao..

		<p class = "log"> Philosophers are such important people. Perhaps, by often saying some things everyone obviously feels but cannot or doesn't be care to articulate, 
		they create a record of thoughts for posterity. I feel calm, and a bit on the lower side, but the Olive oil was invigorating. I almost feasted, with lemon juice and water, 
		Olive oil, and Cod liver oil. I remember the days and days of rich eating, from childhood to when I was around 17, when I first got introduced to fasting. 
		Who could have known back then, when I inadvertently started intermittent fasting, that I would be fasting 96 hours. One thing is for sure, I am averse to fasting 
		for quite sometime after this one ends.
		Let's hope my spirit doesn't fall to lower levels during the last hours. 
		Bon Voyage..
