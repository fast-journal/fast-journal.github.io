		<p class = "log"> Had Coffee with Cinnamon. A nice touch actually. Going for a walk, which should speed up the Ketosis further. 
		A few pangs here and there, a drop in strength demonstrated by lackluster singing, a general dullness, but altogether a good feeling.. 
		To the next log..

		<p class = "log"> Came back from the walk. Felt quite moody, many ups and downs within the 90 odd minutes. Feeling like eating a lot. 
		But that's the difference between want and need. Anyway, the usual questions do arise. As to why I have to bring such things in my life. 
		Why did I tamper with the original algorithm, evidently, because I thought I could write a better one, still, even if that were true, why? 
		Could have just lived a great life instead, a version much better than what others' live(thanks to philosophy). Instead, it's just ideas and words, 
		momentary wisps of candy-floss that simply vanish with just the hint of sweetness, leaving us wanting for more. Already a life with so much denied, 
		and I go further and deny myself even food. One thing is for sure, I am not the person who started the fast. I trust him, I admire him, and I will obey him. 
		But he will have to answer to all of my doubts too. He is a hard taskmaster. Okay I should stop talking about him in the third person. DamnüòÇ
		I just did it again.
		But feeling much better after this, idk if coherent, rant..
		Good for me! üòÖ

		<p class = "log"> Got up before half an hour or so. Went to sleep around 12.30, so that's a good one. The day before I could get just 4 hours, 
		Have to say I feel pretty amazing right now, especially after the meltdown of sorts yesterday, I am sore at the right places and in the right amount, 
		relaxed and well rested. I think I had some palpitations this morning, but it's fine now. I need to get some toys to track the chemical response of my body during fasting.
		I just hope the way I feel is generic i.e not affected by my rationalization. But the latter is hard in physiological stuff. Anyway, we will find out in some time. 
		For the time being, I will cherish, for this is the good zone. Looking forward to the 48 hr crossover and my exercises!

		<p class = "log"> A bit late. I meant to log just after I finished my long walking+thinking session(about 12000 steps, 120 mins).
		The fit app is malfunctioning, showing 2 km for 12k steps, which is funny. Anyway.
		I am still surprised with the way I am feeling. There surely is hunger, I feel it pretty strongly. But idk what's with all the energy. 
		I didn't feel any weakness for all the walking I did, and, more interestingly, I am feeling extra focused and sharp. I walked following Tim Ferris' 
		advice to further catalyze the ketosis, and it seems to be working. Still haven't taken the fats(1 tablespoon olive oil, Cod liver oil) I plan to, 
		nor the lemon water. No Electral either, it contains glucose. Only salt till now. 
		I am not doing those things as long as possible so that I have something to look forward to.
		Fingers crossed to reach 96 hours with the same mental state.
		One moment at a timeü§ò

		<p class = "log"> The sub happy smiley is to account for what I was feeling at that place, that God forbidden ground where I go to walk. 
		White lights are the bane of mankind, they should be gathered and put inside the deepest recesses of hell.
		Making me feel down when there wasn't a need to. There was a moment in the ground, and another when I opened the fridge and saw bread and 
		mayonnaise and jam, to just grab it and put it down. But feeling better now.üòÇ
		To the next log! Chao..

		<p class = "log"> Philosophers are such important people. Perhaps, by often saying some things everyone obviously feels but cannot or doesn't be care to articulate, 
		they create a record of thoughts for posterity. I feel calm, and a bit on the lower side, but the Olive oil was invigorating. I almost feasted, with lemon juice and water, 
		Olive oil, and Cod liver oil. I remember the days and days of rich eating, from childhood to when I was around 17, when I first got introduced to fasting. 
		Who could have known back then, when I inadvertently started intermittent fasting, that I would be fasting 96 hours. One thing is for sure, I am averse to fasting 
		for quite sometime after this one ends.
		Let's hope my spirit doesn't fall to lower levels during the last hours. 
		Bon Voyage..

		<p class = "log"> In the middle of a long long walk, and I cannot believe how happy I really feel. I am at my Nana's house, taking a break for some salt and water, 
		my very much earned drink to keep me going. I am just shy of completing 72 hrs of my fast, and I am thankful that I didn't lose heart and gave in to the temptation 
		of eating something in the low times. It's great to harness and control these highs, at the cost of those lows, for they become predictable. All those platitudes of 
		darkest before the dawn, all troughs lead to crests, all that feel good sayings incarnate.
		I had one of the most fertile sessions of writing in quite sometime. So much, that I am sure I lost more than half of the ideas I had during this time. My mind 
		was wonderfully vibrant, simultaneously in so many places, and I love that feeling of flow that walks often bring.
		A few years back, I would have been anxious and insecure (losing ideas was one of the very few thing that could make me insecure) about losing ideas. Back then, I 
		believed the produce of the mind is precious and rare, and what's lost is lost forever. But now I knowingly smile when I forget an idea I found brilliant at that moment. 
		There's a good chance I overestimated it, and if not, I have a child's pure trust that it will surface, more polished and better, if it was really worth coming out.
		This mental abundance, the lack of need to document every idea, or a couplet.. the effortless nature of something I like about myself is really great.. 
		One of the few pure joys one may experience in life.
		(This assertion got tested just now, when I had typed in everything and it vanished just I was about to save it(something deeply frustrating in a world of dynamic save). 
		Back then I would have been furious. Now, I coolly typed it up again, and I bet it's better more refined than before. Elegant and ergonomic. Feels great when no energy is 
		lost in despair when shit goes wrong)
		This is all the happy spirit of this time thats talking. The lows will come again, like they did yesterday, and the day before. But I have a child's pure trust that the 
		highs definitely are waiting on the other side.
		Ciao, till next time.. Grateful to feel this happy and enjoy it!üôÇ

		<p class = "log"> Feeling pretty great still.
		Fasting and cold bath is a totally wild combination. Fingertips numb for half an hour after that. Idk but I think the water's gone too cold in a couple of hours.
		This cold, I was sweating in peak winter and now, in its twilight, it is suddenly upping the ante. Good for me.
		I like streching myself to the extremes, and that means extreme cold, extreme hunger, extreme heat, extreme physical activities. In this fast, I combined three of the 
		four I have mentioned, Long walks, bodyweight/dumbbell workouts, Cold baths. Bingo. I am still standing, and actually, thriving.
		Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich starker!
		Fasting is pretty elemental. You feel and intuite stuff most people in recent times(~5k years) never felt.
		(From a position of privilege I mean)
		My tryst with fasts started after I read 'The Story of My Experiments with the Truth' by Gandhi, much before this whole culture of intermittent fasting came in. I have no problem 
		with the concept itself, but I often fear that people adopt it, following self proclaimed Gurus on the internet, without willing to experiment themselves. I have been experimenting, 
		unconsciously and consciously since I was a teenager. Does that make me weird? Maybe. 
		But things always make sense or not, in the grand scheme of things, and no one can say for sure.
		Did Gandhi become who he was because he used to fast?
		Was reading the reason behind the success of so many people?
		Maybe in part, but most of these things are what lay people use to rationalize, and explain the wild success of
		people which is mostly irrational, or even if achieved by design, then by a design which is a close intermeshing of an infinite factors. Can you track those factors? Absolutely not.
		Can you try to inculcate the best of them, the choice ingredients that won't go wrong, and then see what happens from there? Surely.
		Anyway I think I digressed. In the least, fasting makes my will stronger. I now know I will die before I become unfit. That's something for a guy who was a baby elephant the best years 
		of his life, the college ones, where so much can happen and so much is to be done. If I have one regret in life, is that I wasn't on my peak stats(local to that time) in college.
		But then, I don't intend to peak in youth, In any way. How many people can say they were in better shape at 30, or 45 than they were at 20,üòé
		I want everything.. great health, the embodiment of youth, and a buttload of money all at the same time. Most people get those things piecemeal, in phases. I want none of that. 
		That stupid platitudes.  I am patient, and I don't have any entitlements about anything. 
		What I know is:
		Ich kann denken. Ich kann warten. Ich kann fasten.üòÇ
		Enough.. I guess it's the post cold bath happy mania speaking..
		So long..

		<p class = "log"> Pretty much constant mental state in the second half of the fast. Suddenly went cold in the night, so not a very comfortable sleep, I guess the fast exacerbated 
		the cold, or maybe not, for everyone else was feeling the same spike. Anyway.
		I am 6 hours away. Which is very gettable, now that I have the other 90 behind me. Like the usual stuff I do, going for the next 50 pages, the next one mile,etc 
		I want to go the next 4 hours till I reach 100 hours. There's something to numbers like these that gets you going.
		Apart from that, the night brought bad dreams. Bad, bizarre dreams. I know what triggered by them, but there's a slight chance that the fast did it. God knows.
		Anyway, I am in perfect spirit now, fuck you to the demons and the people who summon them!
		10 hours to go ü§ò

		<p class = "log"> 15 min away from the threshold. Taking it a bit further by going for a walk the minute I reach 96 hrs. Before the great big meal full of gratitude. 
		Nothing much to say right at this moment. The energy I am feeling seems alien. Counterintuitive.  Some may say I don't know what it will do to my body long term, but that's a 
		question for when that query arises. Now is not the time to be a coward, or a neurotic. And I am pretty much going by sound logic, one that nature devised for me. 
		I am calm, and the 96 hour experiment has been a success. Haven't tracked the weight and stuff, but that's anyway not what interests me.
		Ode to Chris McCandless, Tim Ferris and all the crazy folks out there..

		<p class = "log"> In middle of the long long walk to commemorate my completion of the fast. I am happy as before, but feeling tired now. Is it the fact that I have completed the 
		target and now lack motivation to go further? Probably.
		But one funny thing, today, in all this walk, there have been only a couple of blurry ideas. Flow is real, and it doesn't always happen even if you simulate the same situations. 
		Anyway. the walk beckons. And so does my meal plans for today.
		Pushing on!

		<p class = "log"> This is the last log. Came back from the 7 mile walk, and at the end of my tether now. Fasting is very very tough. They talk about the prehistoric men who had 
		to go without food for long durations, even days at end. But back then, the whole community had to go without food. Even assuming that chivalry existed, and children and old and 
		pregnant women were given food, it's improbable that they feasted lavishly while the men and women went hungry for days at end. It was the community that faced scarcity or abundance. 
		Fasting in 21st century is such an individualist thing(again, in privilege). The whole world, your family, friends everyone is eating sumptuously. The whole streets are lined with food 
		stalls where people, irrespective of whether they are fat or thin, rich or poor, hungry or not, wait in anticipation of the hawker finally preparing their dish and serving it, 
		eager to swallow it whole immediately.
		It may be the fast, but it feels nauseating. I was thinking of eating so much after breaking the fast, but one realises how little one needs to eat to sustain, and how much we are 
		a slave to eating just because of habit.
		Anyway. I am in a very happy mood so chuck all that.
		I wait in anticipation of my premium butter sandwich and bucket load of eggs which I think I have earned. My flatter stomach seems to agree.
		So in an hour, I will have a bit of jaggery with water. 15 min after that, I will eat a bowl or so of curds, to pacify the gut bacteria with a dose of probiotics.
		And then will begin the feast of a lifetime üòÇ
